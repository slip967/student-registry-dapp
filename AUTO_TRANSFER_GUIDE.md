# 🎓 Automatic NFT Transfer to Your Wallet

## ✅ New Feature: Auto-Transfer to MetaMask!

## 🚀 How It Works:

### **Step 1: Connect Your Wallet**

1. Click **"Connect Wallet"** button
2. Approve in MetaMask
3. Your wallet address will be used

### **Step 2: Add Student with Diploma**

1. Fill in student information
2. **Check:** "🎓 Mint Diploma NFT Automatically"
3. (Optional) Upload diploma file
4. Click **"Add Student & Mint Diploma"**

### **Step 3: Automatic Transfer**

The app will:
1. ✅ Add student to blockchain
2. ✅ Mint diploma NFT
3. ✅ **Automatically transfer to YOUR wallet**
4. ✅ Add NFT to MetaMask automatically
5. ✅ Show notification: "Diploma NFT minted and sent to your wallet!"

### **Step 4: View in MetaMask**

1. Open MetaMask

3. You'll see **"Student Diploma"** NFT!
4. It's already in your wallet! 🎉

## 💡 What Changed:

### **Before:**
- NFT minted to contract owner
- Had to manually transfer
- Didn't appear in your wallet automatically

### **Now:**
- NFT minted and **immediately transferred to your wallet**
- Automatically added to MetaMask
- Appears in your NFTs tab instantly!

## ⚠️ Important:

1. **Connect Wallet First:** Make sure MetaMask is connected before adding student
2. **Network:** Must be on Polygon Amoy
3. **Gas Fees:** Relayer pays (you don't pay!)
4. **Auto-Add:** NFT is automatically added to MetaMask

## 🔧 If It Doesn't Work:

### **Problem: "Please connect MetaMask wallet"**
**Solution:**
- Click "Connect Wallet" button first
- Make sure MetaMask is unlocked
- Try again

### **Problem: NFT not in wallet**
**Solution:**
1. Check MetaMask → NFTs tab
2. Refresh the page
3. Check if transfer transaction succeeded (look at notifications)

### **Problem: Transfer failed**
**Solution:**
- The NFT is still minted (check contract owner)
- You can transfer it manually using "Transfer Diploma" section
- Make sure you have the Token ID

## 🎯 Example Flow:

```
1. Connect Wallet → "✓ Connected: 0x1234..."
2. Fill form → Check "Mint Diploma" → Submit
3. ✅ "Student added! TX: 0x..."
4. ✅ "Minting diploma NFT and sending to your wallet..."
5. ✅ "🎓 Diploma NFT minted and sent to your wallet! Token ID: 1"
6. ✅ "NFT added to MetaMask! Check your NFTs tab."
7. Open MetaMask → NFTs → See your diploma! 🎉
```

## 📱 Viewing Your NFT:

1. **MetaMask Extension:**
   - Click MetaMask icon
   - Go to "NFTs" or "Collectibles" tab
   - Find "Student Diploma"

2. **MetaMask Mobile:**
   - Open app
   - Tap "NFTs" tab
   - Your diploma is there!

## 🎉 That's It!

Now when you add a student, the diploma NFT automatically goes to **YOUR wallet** and appears in MetaMask!

**No manual transfer needed - it's automatic!** 🚀

---

**Try it now: Connect wallet → Add student with diploma → Check MetaMask!**

If for any reason the NFT does not appear automatically, you can manually import it into MetaMask using the contract address and Token ID provided in the success message after minting.

# 🌐 How to Access Your Student Registry dApp

## ✅ Server is Running!

Your app is now accessible at:

## 🔗 **http://localhost:3000**

## 📋 Steps to Use:

### 1. **Open Your Browser**
   - Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or any modern browser

### 2. **Go to:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

### 3. **Connect MetaMask**
   - Click "Connect Wallet" button
   - MetaMask will pop up
   - Click "Connect" or "Approve"
   - ✅ You're connected!

## 🎯 Why Localhost?

MetaMask requires **HTTP/HTTPS** connections to work properly. Opening files directly (file://) doesn't work with MetaMask for security reasons.

Now your app runs on **http://localhost:3000** which MetaMask fully supports!

## 🚀 Quick Test:

1. Open: **http://localhost:3000**
2. Click "Connect Wallet"
3. Add a test student
4. Everything should work! ✅

## ⚠️ Important:

- **Keep the server running** (the PowerShell window with `npm start`)
- If you close it, the app won't work
- To restart: `npm start` in the project folder

---

**Your app is ready! Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser! 🎉**
